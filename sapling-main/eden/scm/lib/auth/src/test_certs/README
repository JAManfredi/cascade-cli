This directory contains fake X.509 certificates for use by this crate's tests.
The certificates are self-signed and were generated using the OpenSSL CLI.

To regenerate them, invoke it like this:

openssl req -x509 -newkey -nodes rsa:2048 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 1

The generated files can then be concatenated as needed for the tests.
