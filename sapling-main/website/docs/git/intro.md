# Introduction

## Git integration

Sapling supports Git in 2 modes: `.git` mode, and `.sl` mode.

If you'd like to also run `git` commands, use `git clone` or `git init` to create the repo, then run `sl` commands in it. If you'd like to use `sl` exclusively, benefit more from Sapling's scalability features, use `sl clone` or `sl init` instead.

Refer to [Git support modes](/docs/git/git_support_modes.md) for details.

## Code review system integration

### GitHub

Sapling has builtin support for GitHub. It enables features like showing whether a GitHub Pull Request is accepted or not.

Refer to [Using Sapling with GitHub](/docs/git/github.md) for details.
