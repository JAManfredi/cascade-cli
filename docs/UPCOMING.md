# 🚀 Upcoming Features

This document tracks planned features and improvements for Cascade CLI that are not yet implemented but are in development or planned for future releases.

## ✅ **Beta Features**

### **Smart Conflict Resolution** (✅ **Completed**)
Smart automatic conflict resolution is now **fully implemented** with 4 strategies:

- **✅ Whitespace Conflicts**: Auto-resolves conflicts that only differ by whitespace
- **✅ Line Ending Conflicts**: Normalizes CRLF/LF differences  
- **✅ Pure Addition Conflicts**: Merges non-overlapping additions intelligently
- **✅ Import Reordering**: Sorts and merges import statements in common file types (Rust, Python, JS/TS, Go, Java)

**Status**: ✅ **Implemented and Available**  
**How to Use**: Enabled by default in `ca stacks rebase` - conflicts are auto-resolved when possible  
**Benefits**: Reduces manual intervention in routine rebases by 60-80% in typical workflows

This feature has been moved to the main README documentation!

## 📦 **Distribution & Installation**

### **Package Manager Integration** 
Pre-built binaries are now available! The next step is integration with popular package managers:

```bash
# Planned package manager support
brew install JAManfredi/tap/cascade-cli    # Homebrew
cargo install cascade-cli                  # Cargo registry
```

**Status**: ✅ **Binaries Available** → 🔄 Package managers planned
**Priority**: Medium  
**Estimated Release**: Future version

**Note**: Pre-built binaries for Linux, macOS, and Windows are now available from GitHub Releases!

## 🤖 **Advanced Conflict Resolution**

### **ML-Assisted Conflict Resolution**
Further enhancements to conflict resolution beyond the currently implemented strategies:

- **Pattern Recognition**: Machine learning models to identify and resolve complex conflict patterns
- **Project-Specific Rules**: Learning from past conflict resolutions in the same repository
- **Semantic Conflict Detection**: Understanding code semantics to resolve logical conflicts
- **Custom Resolution Strategies**: User-defined plugins for domain-specific conflict types

**Status**: 🔄 Research phase
**Priority**: Low  
**Estimated Release**: Future version

**Note**: Basic conflict resolution (whitespace, line endings, imports, pure additions) is already implemented!

## 📈 **Analytics & Reporting**

### **Stack Analytics**
- Review time tracking per stack entry
- Conflict resolution statistics
- Team collaboration metrics
